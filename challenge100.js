// A spoonerism is a spoken phrase in which the first letters of two of the words are swapped around, often with amusing results.

// In its most basic form a spoonerism is a two word phrase in which only the first letters of each word are swapped:

// "not picking" --> "pot nicking"

// Your task is to create a function that takes a string of two words, separated by a space: words and returns a spoonerism of those words in a string, as in the above example.

// NOTE: All input strings will contain only two words. Spoonerisms can be more complex. For example, three-word phrases in which the first letters of the first and last words are swapped: "pack of lies" --> "lack of pies" or more than one letter from a word is swapped: "flat battery --> "bat flattery" You are NOT expected to account for these, or any other nuances involved in spoonerisms.

function spoonerize(words) {
  let fw = []
  let arr = words.split(' ')
  arr.forEach(w=>fw.push(w[0]))
  fw.reverse()
  return arr.map((w,i) => fw[i]+w.slice(1)).join(' ')
}
