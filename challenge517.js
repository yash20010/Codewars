// You're in ancient Greece and giving Philoctetes a hand in preparing a training exercise for Hercules! You've filled a pit with two different ferocious mythical creatures for Hercules to battle!

// Orthus

// Orthus

// Hydra

// Hydra

// The formidable "Orthus" is a 2 headed dog with 1 tail. The mighty "Hydra" has 5 heads and 1 tail.

// Before Hercules goes in, he asks you "How many of each beast am I up against!?".

// You know the total number of heads and the total number of tails, that's the dangerous parts, right? But you didn't consider how many of each beast.

// Task
// Given the number of heads and the number of tails, work out the number of each mythical beast!

// The data is given as two parameters. Your answer should be returned as an array:

//  VALID ->      [24 , 15]           INVALID ->  "No solutions"
//             [Orthus, Hydra]
// If there aren't any cases for the given amount of heads and tails - return "No solutions" or null (C#).

function beasts(heads, tails) {
  let o = (5 * tails - heads) / 3
  if (o % 1 !== 0 || o < 0) return 'No solutions'
  let h = tails - o
  if (h < 0) return 'No solutions'
  return [o, h]
}
